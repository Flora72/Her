        Some words never found their way to air.<br>
        They stayed tucked inside, heavy and waiting.<br>
        This is my offering, of truth, of clarity, of peace.<br>
        For you, Bree.

      Sometimes, the hardest letters to write are the ones we never send. But they hold the power to heal, to clarify, to set us free. This is my letter to you, Bree. 
      Not because I expect a reply, or want to reopen old wounds. 
      But because I need to say these things out loud, to finally put them into words. 
      To clear the air, for both of us. So here it is, my truth, my apology, my hope for understanding.
       No matter where life takes us from here, I want you to know this: You mattered.
        You still do. And I’m sorry for the ways I let my fears and insecurities cloud what we had. 
        This letter is my way of making peace with the past, and maybe, just maybe, finding a little clarity in the process.

        To Bree,
        <br>
         I’ve carried this for far too long, and keeping it inside hasn’t made it lighter, only heavier. So this is me finally putting it into words, even if it shakes something in me to write it all down. This isn’t about trying to drag you back into my life or pretending we can hit reset and magically erase the past. It’s just me, raw and honest. Because silence has been suffocating, and I think you deserve to hear what my heart has been holding. When we first became friends,
          it was unlike anything I’d ever had before. You were my person. You made the world feel lighter. You made me feel seen in ways I didn’t know I craved. You were laughter, comfort, safety. And because you were the first real close friend I ever had, I held onto you so tightly, maybe too tightly. But then things changed. Or maybe it was just me changing. I noticed the little distances. The silences. The way I wasn’t sure where I stood in your life anymore. And instead of asking,
           instead of saying “Bree, I’m scared of losing you,” I let fear take over. I let it eat at me until it became jealousy, then anger, then blame. I told myself stories in my head... that I wasn’t enough, that you didn’t care, that you’d replaced me. And instead of owning my feelings, I made you the villain. I blamed you to anyone who would listen. I told people things just so I could feel lighter, so I could feel like it wasn’t my fault. I wanted attention, and I used your name to get it.
            For that, I am deeply, painfully sorry. The truth is, I was petty. I blocked you, muted your statuses, because I couldn’t stand the sight of you moving on. But that didn’t free me. It only made the ache worse. Every time I saw you post, every time I saw you smiling with other friends, calling someone else “best friend,” it tore me apart. Not because you did anything wrong, but because I wanted you to be mine. Mine, and mine only. And when I couldn’t have that, I didn’t know what to do
             except lash out or retreat. I know jealousy doesn’t solve anything, but at the time, it was all I felt. It consumed me. And instead of processing it, I projected it. I turned my pain into distance, and then into silence. Looking back now, I realize I didn’t know how to handle something so close, so real. You were my first real friendship, and I was so scared of losing it that I ended up pushing it away myself. I didn’t know how to love a friend the right way, so I loved you in a way that
              was heavy, selfish, and unfair. And Bree, for all of that… I am sorry. I am sorry for blaming you when it wasn’t your fault. I am sorry for turning my insecurities into anger and directing it at you. I am sorry for making you carry the weight of emotions that were mine to deal with. I am sorry for not being the friend you deserved. I’ve tried to cut ties, thinking it would bring peace, but it hasn’t. Deleting, erasing, blocking, forgetting.None of it worked. Because the truth is, you mattered
               to me. You still do. And no amount of pretending can erase that. I don’t know if there’s space for a rerun of us. Maybe there isn’t. Maybe the chapter has already closed. But if there’s one thing I want you to know, it’s that I never stopped valuing what we had. Even if I handled it badly. Even if I let my flaws speak louder than my heart. You’ll always be part of my story. And I don’t want to remember you with anger or jealousy anymore, only with gratitude. Gratitude for the laughter we shared,
                the comfort you gave, the lessons I learned, even in the hardest ways. Letting go doesn’t mean erasing. It means remembering without resentment. And that’s what I’m trying to do. So thank you, Bree. For being my safe space once, for being the friend who taught me what closeness feels like. I’ll carry that forever, even if life took us down different paths. No matter where you go, I hope life is gentle with you. I hope your friendships bring you joy. I hope you’re loved in the ways you deserve. 
                And I hope you continue to shine in every room you walk into.
      <br> <br>
        With all my heart,
        <br>      
      Love Flo
